      <h1> Climate Change affects our world in many ways:</h1> 
    </div>
    <div class= "highlights" id= problem>
      <div class="oceans revealable">
        <h1> Our oceans will be regularly affected:</h1>
        <p> Oceans are also a part of the carbon cycle. They are in charge of capturing and storing carbon dioxide to feed marine life like phytoplankton and other microorganisms. Furthermore, when marine animals die, the ocean is in charge of taking the carbon from the decaying body and storing/passing it on. However, the carbon from anthropogenic activities, such as burning fossil fuels, will also be taken into the oceans and the carbon cycle at large, and when this carbon settles within the water acidity of the water will increase, affecting the marine life within said water. This could gravely affect pH sensitive marine life like corals and shellfish, as the pH of the water they inhabit can affect their ability to form their skeletons and shells. All of these issues combined can affect the biodiversity of our waters at large. <br>
Sea level can and will also change. Due to the increase in both sea and planetary temperatures, in addition to the rise in greenhouse gasses, ice caps in the arctic, particularly in the north, will begin to melt, releasing excess water around the globe. This excess water can have damaging effects, such as flooding, and the reduction of available inhabitable space by human beings and other organisms.

      </div>
      <div class= "precipitation revealable">
        <h1> The rain we get regularly will change: <br> </h1>
        <p> Another such change is Precipitation. By creating warmer oceans, the amount of water that evaporates from them also increases, thus creating fluctuations in the amount of rainfall seen by different places around the globe. Climate change is known to cause droughts and other major changes in precipitation. <br> On average, total annual precipitation has increased over land areas in the United States and worldwide. Since 1901, global precipitation has increased at an average rate of 0.10 inches per decade, while precipitation in the contiguous 48 states has increased at a rate of 0.20 inches per decade. <br> Although this might seem minimal, if this is left alone over time, it could have damning effects on the world we live in. In addition to melting ice caps, increased rainfall can contribute to rising sea levels, which can later contribute to a myriad of other issues later.

      <div class= "poverty revealable"> 
        <h1> People living in poverty will be affected the most: </h1>
        <p> Rising sea levels resulting from melting ice caps, warming waters, and increased rainfall can result in the flooding and overflowing of different habitats, especially ones around the coast. This results in the displacement of people, usually people in abject poverty, who have to find a new place to resettle. Unfortunately, there is no clear-cut international policy meant to help and assist these refugees, and while there has been talk around the issue, no real work has been done. The pollution caused by climate change also affects more than just our environment. The rampant effects of climate change affects children as well. In addition to the increase in greenhouse gasses, the increase of ozone and other particulate matter can and do result in many different issues arising within children, including and not limited to respiratory diseases like asthma, and can have a long term effect on a child‚Äôs life and human capital </p>

    <h1> Fear not, there are many things you can do to stop it:</h1>
      <div class= "save-water">
        <h2> Save Water!</h2>
        <p>A significant portion of the energy we use to generate electricity and heat is derived from coal, oil, and gas. You can reduce your energy consumption by taking certain measures such as decreasing the use of heating and cooling systems, replacing traditional light bulbs with energy-efficient LED ones, opting for electric appliances that are designed to conserve energy, washing clothes with cold water, and air-drying clothes instead of using a dryer.</p>

        
      </div>
      <div class= "transportation">
        <h2> Choose Alternative Transportation</h2>
        <p> The streets around the world are congested with automobiles, majority of which operate on diesel or gasoline fuels. You can reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and improve your physical health by choosing to walk or cycle instead of driving. When travelling long distances, it is advisable to use a train or bus. You can also reduce the number of vehicles on the road by carpooling whenever possible.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="alternate-foods"> 
      <h2> Eat different foods</h2>
      <p> By consuming more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and reducing your intake of meat and dairy products, you can greatly decrease your environmental footprint. The production of plant-based foods typically generates fewer greenhouse gas emissions and necessitates less energy, land, and water resources.</p>
      </div>
      <div class = "conserve">
        <h2> Reduce, Reuse and Recycle </h2>
        <p> When we purchase electronics, clothing, and other products, each step of the production process, starting from the extraction of raw materials, manufacturing, and transportation to the market, leads to the emission of carbon. To safeguard our environment, it is recommended that we buy fewer items, purchase second-hand goods, repair what is repairable, and recycle whenever possible.</p>

        <p> Climate change is a multifaceted issue that affects everyone all across the world. From greenhouse gas emissions, to displacement. There are so many unique issues that arise from climate change, and such, require many unique solutions that start from the top down. From simply making changes to our own lives, to telling congressmen to create new legislation and changes that will better service children in low income environments, to informing consumers on what they consume. With these small steps we can make the world a better place.
