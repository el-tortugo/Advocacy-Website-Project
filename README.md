# Advocacy Website Project

Hello All, this is my first ever web development project made for CodePath.
It was made in order to complete the Web Developement 101 course, and showcases all of the basics I have learned in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

It includes the following features:

Responsive Buttons, Images and Text all set in HTML and styled in CSS

A responsive header and footer that uses the Flexbox feature
Navbar that moves to different parts of the page

Dark mode written in Javascript and CSS
A form with form validation, which will filter out bad information and highlight the form red when detected. Written in Javascript.
Valid signature is added to the list of signatures through Javascript and CSS
Scrolling Animations written in Javascript and CSS

Pop Up Modal written in Javascript, with the ability to disappear on its own and on command, display a custom message with the user's name, and
an animated image all written in Javascript.

I hope you enjoy my first ever project. I don't think i'll ever alter this website again as I move on to bigger and better projects. I'll leave this
here for anyone who would want to see where I started on this path.

Thank you, and I hope to hear from you soon.
